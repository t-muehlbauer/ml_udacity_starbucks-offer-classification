# Udacity Nanodegree: Data Scientist
# Capstone: Starbucks Classification
## Project Overview and Motivation

The project aimed to analyze customer behavior within the Starbucks rewards mobile app and develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a customer would complete an offer.

Understanding customer behavior and preferences is paramount for businesses to tailor their services effectively. 
The motivation behind this project stemmed from the desire to decode the intricate relationship between demographic attributes and customer actions within the Starbucks rewards program.

## Data

The dataset comprised various features, including demographic information such as age and gender, along with transaction and offer interaction records.

## Approach
- Data Preprocessing: Included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data to gain insights.
- Model Development: Constructed a machine learning model, considering feature importance and prediction accuracy.
- Evaluation: Utilized metrics such as accuracy and F1 score to assess the model's performance.

## Key Findings:

- Model Accuracy: The Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved an impressive accuracy score of 91%, showcasing its proficiency in predicting offer completion within the Starbucks rewards program.
- Feature Importance: Time, reward, and income emerged as the most critical factors influencing offer completion, guiding strategic decision-making.
- Model Robustness: With an F1 score of 0.91 for class 0 and 0.59 for class 1, the model displays a balanced approach in accurately identifying completed offers.

## Conclusion
The project aimed to bridge the gap between demographic characteristics and offer completion rates. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques, it sought to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies and personalized offer recommendations, benefiting the Starbucks rewards program and enhancing customer engagement.
